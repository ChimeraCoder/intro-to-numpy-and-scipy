Introduction to SciPy and NumPy
===================================


This notebook is from a talk that was given on Nov. 14, 2013 at Columbia University.

### Installation and Use

If you have [IPython](http://ipython.org/) installed, you likely already have the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)  installed as well.

Open the IPython notebook web view:

````sh
$ ipython notebook
````

From this web view, you can open any `.ipynb` notebook file saved on your local machine.

Either download the notebook file ([NumPy.ipynb](https://raw.github.com/ChimeraCoder/intro-to-numpy-and-scipy/master/NumPy.ipynb)) directly, or clone this repository, and simply open the file in this web view.


#####Acknowledgements

Special thanks to Anthony Foglia, who provided Powerpoint slides with the two memory layout diagrams, as well as some of the early NumPy examples.
