Introduction to SciPy and NumPy
===================================


This IPython notebook is from a talk that was given on Nov. 14, 2013 at Columbia University.

(Earlier versions of this presentation were given, in slideshow form, in 2012, 2011, and 2010)


### Installation and Use

If you have [IPython](http://ipython.org/) installed, you likely already have the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)  installed as well.

Open the IPython notebook web view:

````sh
$ ipython notebook
````

From this web view, you can open any `.ipynb` notebook file saved on your local machine.

Either download the notebook file ([NumPy.ipynb](https://raw.github.com/ChimeraCoder/intro-to-numpy-and-scipy/master/NumPy.ipynb)) directly, or clone this repository, and simply open the file in this web view.


#### Preview

A static (non-interactive) preview is available at http://nbviewer.ipython.org/7505630.

However, as this preview does include any of the diagrams, images, or output, you probably just want to download this and run it yourself.


#####Acknowledgements

Special thanks to Anthony Foglia, who provided Powerpoint slides with the two memory layout diagrams, as well as some of the early NumPy examples.
